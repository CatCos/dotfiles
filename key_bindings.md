# Key bindings

*Discalimer: Some of the list bindings may not come as default with any VIM program
and thus are specified in ``vimrc`` and ``tmux.conf`` files provided in this
repository.*

The present file contains some of the vim and tmux key bindings that I've came
across along the time.

## VIM
